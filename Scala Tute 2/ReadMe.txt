                                                              â€¢ Comparison of Java and Scala
                      Scala                                                                                    Java
Scala is a combination of both object-oriented and functional programming.                Java is a general-purpose object-oriented language.
Readability is less in Scala.                                                             Readability is more in Java
The process of compiling source code into bytes is slow.                                  The process of compiling source code into byte code is fast.
Scala supports lazy evaluation                                                            Java does not support lazy evaluation.
Scala support operator overloading.                                                       Java does not support operator overloading.
Every method or function is treated as a variable.                                        Java treats every function as an object.
All the operators on entities in Scala are done by using method calls.                    All the operators are treated uniquely and are not done with a method call.
Scala is not backward compatible, which means the code runs in the latest version only.   Java is backward compatible. It allows code to run on older and newer versions also without any error.
